The app is in the dist folder. Don't remove it from the folder, copy the folder instead
I personalized the app for you, it properly simulates the fingerprint enrolment and verification process enough to make your site function properly.

I exported my database to biometrics_site.sql.
Majorly, what you need is the `fingerprint` table assuming your `staff` table still exists

Then,
Modify the simulator.ini file to suit your settings.

Try running run.bat if it fails to startup normally

Later.

PS: q.php is the sample PHP script
